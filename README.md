This project is a Production-Grade Data Dashboard built using Streamlit and Pandas to transform raw fleet telematics data (start/end kilometers) into actionable business intelligence. It provides fleet managers with a real-time view of asset utilization, estimated operational costs, maintenance risk, and geographic distribution.

The application emphasizes data robustness and strategic decision support, enabling quick identification of unused capital and high-risk assets.
